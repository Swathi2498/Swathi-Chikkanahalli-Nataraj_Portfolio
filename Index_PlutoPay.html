                    PlutoPay users need a secure and seamless way to transfer money without relying on traditional card methods,

                    By conducting user research, designers can uncover valuable insights that inform the creation of

            refined through the utilization of the OptimalSort tool, conducting a card sorting test to ensure optimal organization
            and navigation.For the card sorting, I have considered closed card sorting technique to get the result. After counting 
            the test, some features were place in multiple categories and there was a lot of overlap between how participants would 
            organize cards into various categories.

             After creating the wireframes, I progressed to prototype my design using Figma. To gather valuable feedback and insights, 
            I recruited potential app users to participate in user testing sessions and evaluate the prototype's usability and effectiveness.
            <span>
                To assess the user-friendliness and intuitive nature of my design, I conducted usability tests with six participants. 
                Their objective was to complete a series of tasks on PlutoPay, including onboarding, international money transfers, 
                creating budget categories, and accessing investment information. Through their valuable feedback, I identified critical 
                usability issues and friction points, allowing me to prioritize improvements and optimize the overall user 
                experience.
            </span>

                To effectively analyze the extensive amount of information gathered, I utilized an additional affinity map

            The usability test report focused on evaluating the user experience of PlutoPay's key features, including onboarding, 
            international money transfers, creating budget categories, and accessing investment information. Through the testing process, 
            various tasks were assigned to participants to gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of these functionalities. 
            The report presents the findings and results obtained from the tests, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the app's usability.
           <span>
            In addition to the usability tests, a preference test was conducted to gather insights into user preferences and perceptions related to PlutoPay's features. This test aimed to understand user preferences regarding design elements, 
            layout, color schemes, and overall user interface preferences.
           </span>
           <span>
            Two preference tests were conducted on the onboarding and homepage screens which helps to determine the insight into understanding mental models across the target audience, which can,

           </span>
           <span>
            The testing was completed via UsabilityHub and received 13 responses for each test. After reviewing the choices made and the reasons provided,

                PlutoPay, an online payment app, offers users the convenience of shopping, transferring money, and more without the need for 
                a debit or credit card or visiting a physical bank or store. To evoke a sense of confidence, wisdom, and reassurance, 
                the app adopts a clean and minimalist interface predominantly in white, aiming to minimize distractions. The primary color
                chosen is an elegant shade of very light grey, while blue serves as the secondary color to captivate users' attention. Images
                are strategically incorporated to enhance the app's seriousness, 
                ensuring a pleasant and user-friendly experience.
                <span>
            Selecting the right colors, typography, and styles was a challenging process that involved extensive research on other 
            products and drawing inspiration from fellow UI designers. However, after careful consideration, I successfully determined the
            ideal choices for my project.

                In the process of my journey as a UX designer, PlutoPay emerged as a project that gradually took shape. During my training,
                 I delved into various UX research methodologies, adopting a mindset of unbiased exploration and avoiding preconceived notions.
                  Engaging in interviews and usability tests, I discovered the diverse perspectives and mental models of participants, 
                  witnessing how their feedback and experiences influenced and refined the project's initial idea. This journey was not 
                  without challenges, but through perseverance and problem-solving, I navigated the obstacles encountered. Overall, PlutoPay 
                  represents a testament to the transformative power of UX research and the iterative nature of design. Through contemplation, 
                  I am committed to continuously improving and iterating upon PlutoPay,
                 ensuring it remains a user-centric and impactful solution.

                    In addition to the progress made with PlutoPay, this project has also served as a valuable learning opportunity for me as a 
                    UX designer. I have embraced the mindset of continuous learning, recognizing that the process is not yet complete. 
                    There is still much to explore, refine, and iterate upon. With each step, I am committed to further enhancing the user 
                    experience, incorporating new insights, 
                    and evolving PlutoPay into a truly impactful and user-centric solution.
